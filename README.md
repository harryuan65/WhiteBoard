## Pain points

- I want to learn canvas(without any 3rd party packages)
- I want to quickly draw my ideas for discussions
- I want to try drawing with keyboard
- I want to quickily copy what I've drawn and send it to friends via Discord/Line.
- I want to quickily draw custom shapes(like list node, for now)
